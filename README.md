# car-motion

Car-motion is peojrct assined in C++ class at University of Arizona. 

Instruction is as follows. 

"Create a program that will simulate the behavior of a car, based on input files that describe its behavior. 
The input file will include the initial position and orientation of a vehicle, and a set of commands to make it move. 
The output of the program should be a time-series that describes the position and orientation of the vehicle, and records the command given at each time as well..
The data in the input file first describes characteristics of the vehicle (wheelbase) and its initial state. Then, the file contains an array of input values that describe the velocity and steering angle rate of change for the vehicle.
The goal of the project is to simulate a car-like robot's motion. A simple algorithm is applied to simulate the state evolution of the vehicle, based on kinematic motion.
Note: this project is developed by Dr. Jonathan Sprinkle"
